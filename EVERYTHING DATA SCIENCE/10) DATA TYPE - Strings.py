# ACCESSING METHODS OF DATA TYPES, OBJECTS, FUNCTIONS
# - In python, there is a very special SYMBOL that attaches itself to
# data types, objects, fuctions that allows it to access all the possible
# things that they can do

# We use the DOT SYMBOL (.)

# EXAMPLE 1
story = "THE MAN was in the city Of LaGoS"
story1 = story.lower()
story2 = story.upper()
story3 = story.capitalize()
story4 = story.replace("MAN", "Woman")


# EXAMPLE 2
print("These are our prizes: \n    Large - 25 Dollars\n    Medium - 20 Dollars\n    Small - 15 Dollars")
