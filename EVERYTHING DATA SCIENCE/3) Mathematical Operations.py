# MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS IN PYTHON
# -- EXAMPLE (1)
# Find the sum of 9, 3, and 7
number1 = 9
num2 = 3
digit3 = 7

sum = number1 + num2 + digit3

# -- EXAMPLE (2)
# Multiply 8 and 25, divide your answer by 16
a = 8
b = 25
c = 16

solution = (a * b) / c

# -- EXAMPLE (3)
# Multiply 8 and 25, divide your answer by 16 times 12
a1 = 215
b1 = 125
c1 = 116
d1 = 182

solution1 = (a1 * b1) / (c1 * d1)

# -- EXAMPLE (4)
# What is the whole number when 19 divides 3
a2 = 19
b2 = 3

solution2 = (a2 // b2)

# -- EXAMPLE (5)
# What is the remainder when 19 divides 3
a3 = 19
b3 = 3

solution3 = (a3 % b3)

# -- EXAMPLE (6)
# Find the square root of 169
a4 = 169

solution4 = a4 ** 0.5

# -- EXAMPLE (7)
# Square 123456 to the 8th power
a5 = 123456

solution5 = a5 ** 8








# CLASSWORK
"""
1) Given some values, find the simple interest
2) If the radius of a circle is 7cm, Find the area of the circle
3) Given that simple interestis 4200, rate is 2%, time is 3years, 
What is the PRINCIPAL?
4) Given some values, find the area of a Rectangle
5) Find the area of a triangle given some values.


# FORMULA
1) SI = Principal times Rate multiplied by Time everything divided by 100
2) Area of Circle = 22 divided by 7 times radius raised to the second power
3) Principal = Simple Interest times 100 divided by Rate multiplied by time
4) Area of Rectangle = Length times Breadth
5) Area of Triangle = Half times base times height.
